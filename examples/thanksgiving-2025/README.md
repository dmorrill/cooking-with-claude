# Thanksgiving 2025 - Complete Meal Planning Example

This example shows how Claude can help you plan and execute a complex multi-dish holiday meal. Starting with a list of 7 dishes, Claude created:

- A consolidated shopping list
- A 4-day prep schedule
- A detailed day-of cooking timeline
- Oven and stovetop scheduling

## The Menu

An Ottolenghi-inspired vegetarian Thanksgiving for 6-8 guests:

| Course | Dish | Make Ahead? |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Cocktail | Pineapple and Sage Martini | Syrup and puree ahead |
| Main | Spicy Mushroom Lasagne | Assemble 1 day ahead |
| Side | Green Bean Casserole with Rosemary | Components 1 day ahead |
| Side | Sweet Potatoes with Miso-Ginger Sauce | Steam ahead, sear day-of |
| Side | Apple Fennel Slaw with Candied Pecans | Prep veggies ahead |
| Bread | Pumpkin Parker House Rolls | Fresh day-of |
| Dessert | Lemon Labneh Mascarpone Cake | Bake 2 days ahead |

## The Planning Process

### Step 1: Define the Menu
I told Claude what I wanted to serve and asked for a complete plan.

### Step 2: Shopping List
Claude consolidated all ingredients across 7 recipes into a single shopping list, organized by category (produce, dairy, pantry, etc.).

### Step 3: Prep Schedule
Claude analyzed what could be made ahead and created a 4-day schedule:
- **Monday**: Vegetable broth, lemon marmalade, infuse gin
- **Tuesday**: Bake cake layers, make mushroom ragù, candied pecans
- **Wednesday**: Assemble lasagne, make icing, prep all components
- **Thursday**: Assemble cake, bake rolls, final cooking

### Step 4: Day-of Timeline
Claude created an hour-by-hour schedule for Thanksgiving Day:
- 9:00 AM - Assemble cake, start rolls
- 2:30 PM - Bake lasagne
- 4:00 PM - Final cooking sprint
- 5:00 PM - Dinner time!

## How to Use This as a Template

1. **Define your menu** - Tell Claude what dishes you want to serve
2. **Specify constraints** - Number of guests, dinner time, any dietary restrictions
3. **Ask for the plan** - "Create a prep schedule and shopping list for these dishes"
4. **Iterate** - Ask Claude to adjust based on your schedule or preferences

## Example Prompt

```
I'm hosting Thanksgiving dinner for 8 people at 5pm. I want to make:
