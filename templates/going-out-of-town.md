## Step 3: Quick Rescue Recipes

### Veggie Broth (uses almost anything)
**Best for:** Carrots, celery, onions, peppers, tomatoes, wilting herbs, mushrooms
- Chop veggies, simmer 1.5 hours, blend, add miso/salt
- Freezes for 3 months
- Great base for future soups

### Smoothie Freezer Packs
**Best for:** Bananas, berries, leafy greens, yogurt near expiration
- Portion into freezer bags
- Add liquid when ready to blend
- Label with date and contents

### Stir-Fry or Fried Rice
**Best for:** Mixed vegetables, proteins, leftover rice
- Quick cook before leaving
- Eat for dinner or portion and freeze

### Frittata / Egg Bake
**Best for:** Eggs, cheese, vegetables, herbs
- Combine everything, bake at 375°F for 25-30 min
- Eat before leaving or refrigerate for quick meal when home

### Soup
**Best for:** Proteins, beans, grains, vegetables
- More substantial than broth
- Freezes beautifully in portions

### Pesto / Herb Sauce
