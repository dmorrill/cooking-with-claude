# Templates

These templates represent workflows I've developed and refined through real cooking experiences. They're not just formatting guides - they solve actual problems I encountered in the kitchen.

## What's Here

### [prep-and-assemble-workflow.md](prep-and-assemble-workflow.md)

**The Problem:** My partner wanted to learn to cook but felt overwhelmed by recipes that require you to prep, cook, and make decisions all at once. Traditional recipes assume one person does everything, which creates anxiety for new cooks.

**The Solution:** Split cooking into two distinct roles:
- **Prep Person**: Handles all chopping, measuring, sauce-making, and organizes everything into numbered containers
- **Cook Person**: Follows simple step-by-step instructions using the pre-prepped containers

**Why it works:**
- New cooks can focus on just the cooking techniques without multitasking
- The prep person can set everything up in advance and then step back
- Creates a supportive team activity instead of one person doing everything
- Builds confidence gradually - the cook person succeeds every time

**How I use it:** When I want my partner to cook dinner, I do all the prep earlier in the day, organize ingredients into labeled containers (1, 2, 3...), and leave simple instructions. They come home to a "cooking kit" and just follow the steps.

**Ask Claude:** *"Help me convert this stir-fry recipe into a prep-and-assemble workflow with numbered containers"*

### [recipe-template.md](recipe-template.md)

**The Problem:** When I find recipes online or in cookbooks, they're formatted inconsistently. Some bury important timing info, others don't mention equipment, and most don't include the practical notes that make recipes actually work.

**The Solution:** A consistent format that Claude understands and can work with:
- Clear timing info upfront
- Ingredients in a scannable table
- Instructions broken into logical phases (prep, cook, finish)
- Space for the real-world notes that make recipes succeed

**Why it matters:**
- Claude can read and reason about consistently-formatted recipes
- Easy to compare recipes side-by-side
- Notes section captures learnings so you don't repeat mistakes
- Scales and adapts more easily

**How I use it:** When I find a recipe I want to keep, I ask Claude to convert it to this format. Over time, my whole collection becomes searchable and Claude can answer questions like "what recipes use tahini?" or "what can I make in 30 minutes?"

**Ask Claude:** *"Convert this recipe to my standard template format"*

### [shopping-list-template.md](shopping-list-template.md)

**The Problem:** Shopping lists scattered across notes apps, paper scraps, and text messages. No consistent format, easy to forget things, hard to organize by store section.

**The Solution:** A structured template organized by store section (produce, protein, dairy, etc.) that Claude can generate from meal plans or recipes.

**Why it works:**
- Organized by how you walk through the store
- Links items back to which recipe needs them
- Running list section for staples you notice running low
- Easy to check off on your phone

**How I use it:** When I plan meals for the week, I ask Claude to generate a shopping list from those recipes. It consolidates duplicates (if two recipes need onions, it adds them up) and organizes everything by store section.

**Ask Claude:** *"Generate a shopping list for these three recipes, organized by store section"*

## Creating Your Own Templates

These templates evolved from my specific needs. Yours might be different! Some ideas:

- **Meal prep template** - For batch cooking on Sundays
- **Kid-friendly recipe format** - Simpler language, visual cues
- **Dietary restriction checklist** - For guests with allergies
- **Camping/outdoor cooking format** - Equipment constraints, no-refrigeration notes

Ask Claude to help you design templates that match how you actually cook.
