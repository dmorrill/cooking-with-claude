# Prep-and-Assemble Workflow Template

A collaborative cooking mode where one person handles all prep work and another handles cooking/assembly. Perfect for teaching new cooks, reducing kitchen anxiety, or making cooking a team activity.

## Overview

**Roles:**
- **Prep Person**: All chopping, measuring, sauce-making, and station setup
- **Cook Person**: Following instructions to cook and assemble the final dish

**Why it works:**
- Reduces overwhelm for less experienced cooks
- Creates clear division of labor
- Prep person can guide without hovering
- Cook person gets hands-on experience with support

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Recipe Selection
Choose recipes that work well for this mode:
- **Best:** Cold noodle salads, stir-fries, Buddha bowls, tacos, grain salads
- **Good:** Pasta dishes, sheet pan meals, salads with cooked proteins
- **Avoid:** Baking, recipes requiring simultaneous multi-tasking

### 2. Ingredient Check
Before starting prep:
- [ ] Verify all ingredients are available
- [ ] Note any substitutions needed
- [ ] Check equipment is available and clean

### 3. Container Organization

Organize prepped ingredients into numbered containers based on when they're used:

| Container | Contents | When Used |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | First ingredients added | Step 1-2 |
| 2 | Second batch | Step 3-4 |
| 3 | Near end ingredients | Step 5-6 |
| 4 | Final toppings/garnish | Finish |

**Tips:**
- Label containers with step numbers
- Group ingredients used together
- Keep wet and dry separate
- Prep garnishes last (stay fresh)

### 4. Prep Instructions Format

For each ingredient, provide:
- **Exact quantity**: "1 cup" not "some"
- **Cut specification**: "1/4-inch dice" not "chopped"
- **Visual reference**: "matchstick size" or "thumbnail size"

**Example:**
```
Container 1 - Vegetables (Steps 2-3):
- 1 red bell pepper: Remove seeds, slice into 1/4" strips
- 1 cucumber: Peel, cut into matchsticks (1/4" x 1/4" x 3")
- 2 green onions: Slice thin on diagonal, whites and greens separated
```

### 5. Station Setup

Before cook person starts, arrange:

**Left to Right (order of use):**
```
[Container 1] → [Container 2] → [Container 3] → [Container 4]
```

**Equipment ready:**
- Pans/pots on stove
- Utensils within reach
- Serving dishes nearby
- Towels and oven mitts accessible

**Optional extras:**
- Extra seasonings for adjusting
- Citrus wedges for brightness
- Fresh herbs for garnish

### 6. Cooking Instructions Format

For the cook person, provide:

```
Step 1: [Action] + [Sensory Cue]
- "Heat oil until shimmering"
- "Sauté until onions are translucent (3-4 min)"
- "Cook until edges are golden brown"

Step 2: [Action] + [Container Reference]
- "Add Container 1 (vegetables)"
- "Stir in Container 2 (sauce)"
```

**Include:**
- Time estimates
- Visual/smell/sound cues for doneness
- What to do if something goes wrong

### 7. Troubleshooting Section

Common issues and solutions:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Pan smoking | Reduce heat, add more oil |
| Food sticking | Let it cook longer before flipping |
| Sauce too thick | Add splash of water/broth |
| Sauce too thin | Cook longer to reduce |
| Over-seasoned | Add acid (lemon) or starch (rice) |
| Under-seasoned | Add salt in small amounts, taste between |
