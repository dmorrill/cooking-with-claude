**Flavor Building:**
- Better Than Bouillon adds concentrated beef flavor
- Worcestershire adds umami depth
- Reserved drippings add rich beef fat and flavor

**Drippings:**

- Refrigerate overnight - fat will solidify on top
- Use both fat and gelatinous juices for au jus

**Storage:**
- Can be made ahead and reheated
- Keeps 3-4 days refrigerated
- Reheat gently before serving

**Make-Ahead:**
- Make base earlier in the day
- Add drippings just before serving for best flavor

**Serving:**
- Serve in small bowls for dipping
- Keep warm on stove or in warmer
- Essential for French dip-style sandwiches

**Variations:**
