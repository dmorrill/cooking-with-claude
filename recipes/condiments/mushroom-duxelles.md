2. Cook until mixture is dark, concentrated, and jammy

4. Taste and adjust seasoning

### Notes

**Key Technique:**
- **Dry cooking first** removes moisture for concentrated flavor
- Adding fat too early = steaming instead of browning
- Final texture should be thick paste, not wet

**Uses for Duxelles:**
- Spread on toast or crostini
- Mix into risotto or pasta
- Top for steak or chicken
- Filling for puff pastry
- Stir into soups for umami boost

**Storage:**
- Refrigerated: 4-5 days in airtight container
- Frozen: Up to 3 months
- Portion into ice cube tray for easy use

**Make-Ahead:**
- Perfect make-ahead component
- Flavor improves with time

**Troubleshooting:**
- If duxelles is too dry/crumbly after refrigerating, stir in 1-2 tbsp crème fraîche to loosen and add creaminess
- Large batches can be oven-roasted at 400°F on sheet pans first (20-30 min) to drive off moisture, then finished on stovetop with butter and aromatics

**Variations:**
- Add splash of brandy or sherry after cooking
- Use all butter for richest flavor
- Mix mushroom varieties for complexity
- Add fresh parsley at the end

**Future Uses:**
- Excellent pantry staple
- Elevates many dishes
- Use on crostini for appetizers
