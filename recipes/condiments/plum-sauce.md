## Instructions

### Step 1: Overnight Maceration (8-12 hours)
1. Combine plums with sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, five-spice, star anise, chili flakes, and salt
2. Cover and refrigerate 8-12 hours
3. This draws out juices and deepens flavor

### Step 2: Sauté Aromatics (2-3 minutes)
4. Heat neutral oil in heavy pot over medium
5. Add garlic and shallot; sauté until fragrant (don't brown)

### Step 3: Simmer (50-60 minutes)
6. Add all macerated plums and liquid
7. Bring to gentle boil, reduce to low
8. Simmer uncovered 50-60 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thick and glossy

### Step 4: Blend and Finish
9. For smooth sauce, use immersion blender to purée
10. Simmer 5-10 more minutes to thicken
11. Remove from heat, stir in sesame oil
12. Taste and balance: splash of vinegar if too sweet, pinch of sugar if too tart

## Uses

- **Duck glaze**: Brush on duck during last 15 minutes of smoking/roasting
- **Dipping sauce**: Serve alongside smoked or roasted duck
- **Plum jus**: Deglaze drip pan with stock, whisk in a spoonful
- **Best smoking woods**: Apple, cherry, or tea smoke

## Notes

- **Maceration**: Optional but deepens flavor significantly
- **Plum skins**: Keep for color, body, and pectin
- **Texture options**: Leave chunky for rustic, blend smooth for lacquer glaze
- **Refresh after thawing**: Simmer with dash of vinegar to revive brightness
