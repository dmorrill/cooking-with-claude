4. Add garlic; sauté until fragrant (30 seconds)
5. Stir in za'atar, fenugreek, sumac, cumin, and paprika
6. Toast gently 30-60 seconds until aromatic

9. Blend until completely smooth and creamy
10. Adjust consistency with water (thicker for spread, thinner for drizzle)

- **Consistency**: Thickens when warmed, keep slightly thinner than desired
- **Make-ahead**: Flavor improves after 24 hours
