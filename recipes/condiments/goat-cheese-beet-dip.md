### Notes

**Texture Goal:**
- Cohesive enough to scoop but not fully smooth
- Visible beet pieces add visual appeal and texture
- Goat cheese should be very soft for easy mixing

**Make-Ahead:**
- Roast beet 2-3 days ahead
- Mix dip up to 24 hours before serving
- Flavor improves with time

**Serving:**
- Serve with pita chips, vegetables, or crackers
- Part of holiday appetizer platter
- Beautiful pink color is visually striking

**Storage:**
- Keeps 3-4 days refrigerated
- Bring to room temp before serving for best flavor

**Variations:**
- Add champagne vinegar for sharper tang
- Substitute feta for saltier profile
- Use tahini + cashew cheese for vegan version
- **White bean extender:** Use 113g goat cheese + 100-120g white beans (drained) + 120-130g beet + herbs (dill). Blend smooth in food processor. Great for stretching goat cheese and adds creaminess. Works for both dip and pipeable tartlet filling.
- **Smooth/pipeable version:** Blend all ingredients in food processor until smooth. Put in zip-lock bag with piping tip for easy tartlet filling.

**Platter Suggestions:**
- Pair with hummus, olive tapenade, vegetables
- Serve alongside phyllo tartlets

**Holiday Timeline:**
