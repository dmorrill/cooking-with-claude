### Instructions

#### Step 1: Start Pasta Water (5-7 minutes to boil)
1. Fill large pot with water and bring to boil
2. Salt generously (pasta water should taste like the sea)
3. Add bucatini and cook according to package directions (usually 9-11 minutes)
4. **SAVE 1-2 CUPS PASTA WATER** before draining

#### Step 2: Cook Aromatics (5-6 minutes)
5. While pasta water heats, start sauce in large sauté pan over medium heat
6. Add butter or olive oil to coat pan
7. Add chopped shallot, cook 2-3 minutes until soft and translucent
8. Add chopped red onion, cook another 2-3 minutes
9. Add chopped garlic, cook 30-60 seconds until fragrant (don't burn)

#### Step 3: Add Mushrooms (5-7 minutes)
10. Increase heat to medium-high
11. Add sliced mushrooms to pan
12. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and liquid evaporates (5-7 minutes)
13. Season with salt and pepper

#### Step 4: Build Cream Sauce (2-3 minutes)
14. Add 1 cup heavy cream to mushroom mixture
15. Let simmer and reduce slightly for 2-3 minutes
16. Taste and adjust seasoning

#### Step 5: Finish Sauce (3-4 minutes)
17. Lower heat to low
18. Add grated pecorino romano gradually, stirring constantly
19. Reserve about ½ cup cheese for topping
20. If sauce is too thick, add pasta water 2-3 tablespoons at a time to loosen
21. Taste and adjust salt and pepper

#### Step 6: Combine and Serve (1-2 minutes)
22. Add drained bucatini directly to sauce pan
23. Toss pasta with sauce until well coated
24. Add more pasta water if needed to create silky consistency
25. Toss in chopped fresh parsley
26. Serve immediately, topped with reserved cheese

### Pro Tips
- **Timing trick**: Start pasta water when you begin cooking aromatics so everything finishes together
- **Pasta water is magic**: The starchy water helps sauce cling to pasta and adjusts consistency perfectly
- **Don't overcook mushrooms**: Let them brown properly - this develops deep umami flavor
- **Cheese melting**: Add cheese off high heat and stir constantly to prevent clumping
- **Bucatini choice**: The hollow center grabs cream sauce beautifully

### Cooking Notes & Modifications
- **Original version used Gruyere + Pecorino Romano** - Gruyere caused congealing/clumping as sauce cooled
- **RECOMMENDED: Use Pecorino Romano only** for smoother, silkier sauce that stays creamy
- **Better cheese alternatives**: Parmesan, Fontina, or Mascarpone also melt smoothly in cream
- **Avoid Gruyere in cream sauces** - high protein content causes stringy, clumpy texture

### Storage & Reheating
- **Best eaten fresh** - cream sauces can separate when reheated
- **Refrigerate leftovers** up to 2 days in airtight container
- **Reheat gently** over low heat with splash of cream or pasta water to restore consistency
