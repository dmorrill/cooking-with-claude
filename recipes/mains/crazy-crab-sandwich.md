## Instructions

### Step 1: Pick the Crab Meat (30-40 minutes)
1. Remove triangular belly flap from each crab
2. Turn belly-down and lift off back shell from rear
3. Optional: Scoop golden crab butter into small bowl
4. Remove reddish membrane and discard spongy gills, rinse body
5. Extract meat gently:
   - **Body meat**: Use crab leg tip or chopstick to push from channels
   - **Knuckle meat**: Don't miss this - it's the sweetest part!
   - **Legs & claws**: Crack gently to keep meat in large chunks
6. Keep meat in large, beautiful chunks
7. Expected yield: 15-16 oz picked crabmeat

### Step 2: Prepare Crab Mixture (5 minutes)
8. Pat crabmeat gently with paper towels to remove excess moisture
9. In medium bowl, whisk together: mayo, lemon juice, salt, pepper
10. Add crabmeat and fold gently with rubber spatula
11. Don't overmix - preserve those beautiful lumps!

### Step 3: Make Garlic Butter (5 minutes)
12. In small saucepan, combine: butter, garlic, salt, pepper flakes
13. Heat over medium, stirring constantly
14. Cook until garlic is sizzling and fragrant (about 2 minutes)
15. **Do NOT let garlic brown** - remove when golden
16. Remove from heat and stir in olive oil

### Step 4: Grill the Sourdough (5-7 minutes)
17. Heat large skillet over medium heat
18. Brush garlic butter generously on one side of each slice
19. Place bread butter-side down in skillet
20. Cook 2-3 minutes until deep golden brown with crispy edges
21. No need to toast both sides

### Step 5: Assemble Sandwiches
22. Place one slice grilled sourdough on each plate, grilled side up
23. Add tomato slice
24. Heap 5-6 oz crab mixture generously on each
25. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley
26. Add crack of fresh black pepper
27. Top with second slice, grilled side facing crab

### Step 6: Serve
28. Serve immediately with lemon wedges
29. Encourage squeezing lemon over crab
30. Enjoy while bread is warm and crispy!

## Notes

- **Expected crab yield**: A 1.75-2 lb cooked crab yields 7.5-8 oz meat. Two crabs = 15-16 oz total
- **Handle crab gently**: Use rubber spatula, don't overmix or break up lumps
- **Pat dry**: Remove excess moisture to avoid watery filling
- **Don't brown garlic**: Burnt garlic is bitter
- **Olive oil addition**: Makes butter smoother and helps penetrate the bread
- **Magic is in simplicity**: Let sweet Dungeness shine!
- **Make-ahead**: Crab picking can be done 4 hours ahead; garlic butter can be made 2 days ahead; crab salad should be mixed no more than 30 minutes before serving
