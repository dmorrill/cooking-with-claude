### Notes
- **Mushroom magic**: Finely minced mushrooms add umami and help achieve meaty texture
- **Pressing is crucial**: Well-pressed tofu crumbles better and crisps up
- **Spice authenticity**: Cinnamon and cloves are traditional in Mexican chorizo - don't skip!
- **Texture tip**: Cook longer for crispier bits, shorter for softer texture
- **Batch cooking**: Doubles easily for meal prep
- **Nutrition boost**: High protein (tofu), added vegetables (mushrooms), no preservatives
- **Customization**: Adjust cayenne for heat preference, add chipotle powder for smokiness
- **Oil note**: Can reduce oil to 1 Tbsp for lower fat version
