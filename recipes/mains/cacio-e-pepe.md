# Cacio e Pepe (Single Serving)

Classic Roman pasta with cheese and pepper - simple, elegant, perfect.

**Prep Time:** 5 min | **Cook Time:** 10 min | **Servings:** 1

## Ingredients

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Bucatini | 3 oz |
| Parmesan cheese, finely grated | 1 cup |
| Black pepper, freshly cracked | 1 tsp |
| Salt | for pasta water |
| Lemon zest (optional) | small amount |

## Instructions

1. **Boil pasta** in heavily salted water until 2 minutes before al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining!
2. **Toast pepper** in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant (about 1 minute)
3. **Add ¼ cup pasta water** to the pepper in the skillet and let it simmer
4. **Transfer pasta** to skillet with tongs (bringing some starchy water with it)
5. **Off heat**: Add grated cheese gradually while tossing constantly to create an emulsion
6. **Add pasta water** in small splashes while tossing vigorously to create a creamy sauce (not clumpy!)
7. **Optional**: Finish with a touch of lemon zest on top for brightness

## Notes

- **The magic is in the emulsion**: Starchy pasta water + cheese + constant tossing = creamy sauce
- **Work off heat** when adding cheese to prevent clumping
- **Extra cheese is key**: 1 cup (2x the typical amount) makes it much better and creamier
- **Don't skimp on the pepper** - it's half the name of the dish!
- **Serve immediately** - the sauce tightens as it cools
- Use a Microplane or finest grater for best melting results
- Traditional recipe uses Pecorino Romano, but good Parmesan works great
