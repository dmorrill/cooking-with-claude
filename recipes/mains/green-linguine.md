## Instructions

1. **Prep ice bath**: Fill large bowl with ice and cold water

2. **Blanch kale**: Bring salted water to boil, add kale for 45-60 seconds, transfer immediately to ice bath. Don't squeeze completely dry - some moisture helps blending

3. **Cook pasta**: Use same water. Cook until just al dente (add 1-2 min for altitude). Reserve ¾ cup pasta water before draining

4. **Cook edamame**: Boil or microwave 3-4 minutes, drain

5. **Sauté shallot**: Heat 1 tsp oil in small pan, cook shallot 3-4 min until soft and translucent. Don't brown - keep heat gentle

6. **Blend sauce**: Add to blender:
   - Blanched kale
   - Cooked edamame
   - Arugula
   - Parsley
   - Sautéed shallot
   - Garlic
   - Lemon juice
   - Egg yolk
   - Miso
   - Nutritional yeast
   - 1 tbsp olive oil
   - Salt and pepper

   Blend until silky and bright green. Adjust: too thick → add pasta water; too thin → add more nutritional yeast

7. **Warm sauce gently**: Transfer to large pan over **very low heat**. Don't cook the yolk - just warm slightly

8. **Emulsify**: Add pasta to warm sauce with pasta water splashes. Toss continuously 1-2 minutes until glossy and creamy

9. **Serve**: Top with optional raw egg yolk, parmesan, parsley, olive oil, black pepper, lemon zest

## Notes

- **Flavor profile**: Peppery from arugula, deeply savory from miso + shallot + nutritional yeast, silky from yolk and pasta water
- **High protein**: Edamame adds plant protein while blending seamlessly into the sauce
- **Dairy-light**: No dairy in the sauce itself, only optional parmesan topping
- **Gentle heat is key**: Keep heat low when warming sauce and emulsifying to prevent yolk from cooking
- **The magic is in the emulsion**: Starchy pasta water + greens + yolk = creamy, glossy sauce
- **Altitude adjustment**: Pasta needs 1-2 minutes longer than package directions at 5,000+ feet
