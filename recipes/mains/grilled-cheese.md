## Notes

- **Cheese pairing**: Sharp aged cheddar + smoky cheddar creates perfect flavor balance
- **Tomato roasting**: Concentrates flavor and reduces moisture (no soggy sandwich)
- **Bread thickness**: Thick-cut sourdough provides sturdy base and great texture contrast
- **Temperature control**: Medium heat prevents burning while allowing cheese to melt fully
- **Make-ahead**: Roast tomatoes in advance; assemble and grill when ready to serve
- **Variations**: Add fresh basil leaves or arugula for extra flavor
- **Perfect pairing**: Serve with homemade tomato soup
