# Quick Altitude Pizza Dough

Fast-rise semolina pizza dough optimized for high altitude with maple syrup yeast activation.

**Prep Time:** 10 min | **Rise Time:** 20-40 min | **Total Time:** 45-60 min | **Yield:** 1 large or 2 medium pizzas

## Ingredients

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Warm water | ~1 cup |
| Active dry or instant yeast | ~2 Tbsp (generous for fast rise) |
| Maple syrup | ~1 Tbsp |
| Semolina flour | 1¼ cups |
| All-purpose flour | ⅓ cup+ (add by feel) |

## Equipment
- Pizza stone (preheat in oven)
- Parchment paper
- Pizza spatula/peel

## Instructions

### Step 1: Activate Yeast
1. Combine ~1 cup warm water, ~2 Tbsp yeast, and maple syrup in a bowl
2. Stir and let activate briefly (yeast will start to foam)

### Step 2: Preheat Oven
3. Place pizza stone in oven and preheat to **550°F**
4. Let stone preheat for at least 30-45 minutes for best results

### Step 3: Mix Dough
5. Add **1¼ cups semolina flour** to the yeast mixture and stir
6. Add **⅓ cup all-purpose flour** to start
7. Continue adding AP flour gradually until dough is slightly sticky but workable

### Step 4: Knead and Develop Gluten
8. Work the dough by hand, kneading until gluten begins to form
9. Dough should become smooth and elastic (slightly sticky is okay)
10. Knead for 3-5 minutes total

### Step 5: Rise
11. Cover bowl with clean towel or plastic wrap
12. Let rise in warm spot until doubled in size (20-40 minutes at altitude)
13. Meanwhile, prep your toppings

### Step 6: Shape and Bake
14. Shape dough into a round directly on a piece of parchment paper
15. Add your toppings
16. Use pizza spatula to transfer pizza AND parchment paper onto the preheated stone
17. **Turn oven down to 350°F** once pizza goes in
18. Bake until cheese has little bits of golden edges (typically 12-18 minutes)

## Notes

- **Altitude optimization**: Extra yeast (2 Tbsp) compensates for faster rise at high altitude
- **Maple syrup**: Feeds the yeast for faster activation and adds subtle sweetness
- **Semolina flour**: Provides excellent chew, crispy texture, and helps prevent sticking
- **Slightly sticky dough**: Don't over-flour - slightly sticky dough = better texture
- **Gluten development**: Work the dough enough to feel it become elastic and smooth
- **Parchment paper trick**: Makes transfer foolproof, prevents sticking, can slide right onto stone
- **Temperature drop**: Starting at 550°F preheats the stone thoroughly, then 350°F prevents burning
- **Visual doneness cue**: Golden edges on cheese = perfectly baked
- **Timing varies**: Rise time depends on altitude and room temperature - check for doubled size, not clock
- **Flour ratio**: ~2:1 semolina to AP flour, but adjust AP by feel for right texture
