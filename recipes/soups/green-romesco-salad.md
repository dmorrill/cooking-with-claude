## Instructions

### Phase 1: Roast Vegetables (20 minutes)
1. Preheat oven to 425°F
2. Wash and slice zucchini into half-moons
3. Wash and halve or quarter mini eggplants (keep skin on)
4. Toss vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper
5. Spread on sheet pan in single layer and roast 18-20 minutes until golden and tender

### Phase 2: Cook Grains (15 minutes)

**Option A - Couscous Only:**
1. Heat 2 cups bean broth in saucepan until simmering
2. Add pearl couscous and cook 10-12 minutes until tender
3. Fluff with fork

**Option B - Couscous + Quinoa Combo:**
1. Heat 2.5 cups bean broth in saucepan until simmering
2. Add quinoa first, simmer 10 minutes
3. Add pearl couscous, cook additional 8-10 minutes
4. Check both grains for doneness, drain excess liquid if needed
5. Fluff with fork

### Phase 3: Make Green Romesco (10 minutes)
1. Keep nuts raw (skip toasting to reduce AGE formation)
2. In food processor, combine raw nuts, minced garlic, and roughly chopped herbs (including radish greens if using)
3. Add lemon juice and zest
4. Drizzle olive oil while processing until desired consistency
5. Season with salt and pepper

### Phase 4: Assemble Salad (5 minutes)
1. Combine warm grains and beans in large bowl
2. Add roasted zucchini and eggplant
3. Fold in green romesco
4. Toss gently to combine

## Notes

- **Make-ahead**: Romesco can be made 1 day ahead; grains can be cooked earlier and reheated
- **Substitutions**: Any herbs work for romesco; radish greens add peppery flavor
- **Storage**: Keeps 3 days refrigerated; serve at room temperature or slightly warm
- **Grain choice**: Dual-grain version adds protein and texture variety
- **Health optimization**: Raw nuts reduce AGE (Advanced Glycation End-product) formation
- **Vegetables**: Mini eggplants add meaty texture
- **Serving**: Great as main course or side dish; pairs with crusty bread
