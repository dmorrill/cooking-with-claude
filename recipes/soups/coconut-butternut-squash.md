|------|--------|
| Butternut squash | 1360g (~3 lbs) |
| Olive oil | 4 Tbsp |
| Large yellow onions, chopped | 2 |
| Medium apples, peeled and diced | 2 |
| Vegetable broth | 4 cups |
| Curry powder | 4 tsp |
| Fresh ginger, grated | 4 tsp |
| Ground nutmeg or allspice | ¼ tsp |

### Garnish
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Red onions, thinly sliced | 4 medium |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Bake the Squash (30-50 minutes)
1. Preheat oven to 375°F
2. Cut squash in half lengthwise and scoop out seeds
3. Place halves cut side up in foil-lined shallow baking dish
4. Cover tightly with more foil
5. Bake 30-50 minutes until you can easily pierce flesh with a knife
6. Scoop out flesh and set aside (discard skins)

### Step 2: Sauté Onions (8-10 minutes)
7. Heat 2 Tbsp oil in large soup pot over medium-low heat
8. Add chopped yellow onions
9. Sauté until golden, about 8-10 minutes

### Step 3: Simmer Soup Base (10 minutes)
10. Add diced apples, baked squash, vegetable broth, curry powder, grated ginger, and nutmeg
11. Bring to a steady simmer
12. Cover and simmer gently until apples are tender, about 10 minutes

### Step 4: Purée Soup
13. **Option A**: Transfer solids to food processor with slotted spoon (in batches if needed), purée until smooth, then return to pot
14. **Option B** (easier): Use immersion blender directly in pot and blend until smoothly puréed

### Step 5: Add Coconut Milk (5-10 minutes)
15. Stir in coconut milk
16. Return soup to gentle simmer over low heat
17. Cook 5-10 minutes until well heated through
18. Season with salt and pepper to taste
19. **Optional**: Let soup stand off heat for 1-2 hours for flavors to meld, then reheat before serving

### Step 6: Prepare Garnish (5 minutes)
20. Just before serving, heat remaining 2 Tbsp oil in large skillet
21. Add sliced red onions and sauté over low heat until golden and soft

### Step 7: Cook Kale (5 minutes)
22. Strip kale leaves from stems and cut into thin shreds
23. Add kale to skillet with onions
24. Add just enough water to moisten the surface
25. Cover and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until kale is bright green and just tender (about 5 minutes)

### Step 8: Serve
26. Ladle soup into each bowl
27. Place a small mound of kale and onion mixture in the center of each bowl

## Notes

- **Make-ahead**: Soup can be made 1-2 days ahead; flavor improves with time
- **Storage**: Refrigerate up to 5 days, or freeze up to 3 months
- **Squash prep**: Can bake squash a day ahead to speed up day-of cooking
- **Garnish timing**: Make kale-onion topping fresh just before serving for best color and texture
- **Soup texture**: Should be smooth and creamy without any chunks
- **Apple variety**: Any apple works - Fuji, Gala, Honeycrisp, or Granny Smith
- **Vegan**: Completely plant-based and hearty enough for a main course
- **Serving suggestion**: Pair with crusty bread for a complete meal
