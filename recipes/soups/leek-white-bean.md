## Ingredients

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Large leeks (white and light green parts) | 4, cleaned and sliced |
| Garlic cloves, minced | 4 |
| Extra virgin olive oil | 1 Tbsp |
| Dry white wine | 1 cup (quality matters - use a Rhône-style white blend) |
| Vegetable stock | 6 cups |
| White beans with liquid | 1.5-2 cups (cannellini, great northern, or navy) |
| Bay leaves | 2 |
| Salt | to taste |
| Fermented white pepper or black pepper | to taste |
| Cayenne (optional) | pinch |
| Green onions, chopped (optional) | for garnish |
| French baguette (optional) | for croutons |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Slow-Caramelize the Leeks (10-15 minutes)
1. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in large, heavy soup pot over **medium-low heat**
2. Add sliced leeks and generous pinch of salt
3. Cook **lid off**, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes until:
   - Very soft and translucent
   - Sweet-smelling (not sharp/oniony)
   - Light golden edges appearing
   - Can easily smash with spoon against pot
4. **Don't rush this step** - the slow caramelization builds maximum flavor depth
5. If leeks start sticking, add 1-2 Tbsp stock to deglaze (adds flavor!)

### Step 2: Add Garlic (1 minute)
6. Stir in minced garlic
7. Cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute until fragrant
8. Don't let garlic brown or burn

### Step 3: Double Wine Reduction (6-10 minutes) ⭐ Key Technique
9. **First reduction**: Add ½ cup white wine to pot
10. Increase heat to **medium**
11. Cook 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until wine is mostly absorbed/evaporated
12. Wine will soak into leeks like a sponge - this is perfect!
13. **Second reduction**: Add remaining ½ cup white wine
14. Cook another 3-4 minutes until reduced and concentrated
15. This double reduction creates incredible depth and caramelized complexity

*Altitude note: At 5,280 feet, wine reduces faster - watch closely*

### Step 4: Simmer the Soup (30 minutes)
16. Add vegetable stock, bay leaves, and entire can of white beans (including liquid)
17. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat
18. Once boiling, reduce heat to low
19. **Cover with lid** and simmer gently for 30 minutes
20. Stir occasionally to ensure even cooking

### Step 5: Remove Bay Leaves & Purée (5 minutes)
21. **Important**: Fish out and discard both bay leaves before blending!
22. Use immersion blender to purée soup directly in pot until completely smooth and creamy
23. **OR** Transfer in batches to regular blender (only fill halfway, remove center cap, cover with towel)
24. Blend 1-2 minutes until silky with no chunks
25. The white beans create incredible creaminess without any dairy

### Step 6: Final Seasoning & Serve
26. Taste and adjust seasoning:
    - Add fermented white pepper (or black pepper) to taste
    - Pinch of cayenne for subtle warmth (optional)
    - More salt if needed
27. Heat through over low heat for 2-3 minutes
28. Ladle into bowls
29. **Optional garnishes**: Chopped green onions, croutons from toasted baguette, drizzle of olive oil

## Notes

- **Slow leek cooking**: The 10-15 minute low-and-slow method develops sweet, caramelized flavor
- **Lid off for leeks**: Allows moisture to evaporate and leeks to caramelize; lid goes on only for the simmer
- **Double wine reduction**: Creates layered, concentrated wine flavor - more complex than single reduction
- **High-quality wine matters**: Use a wine you'd enjoy drinking
- **Bean liquid is key**: Don't drain beans - the starchy liquid adds body and creaminess
- **Fermented white pepper**: More complex and funky than regular black pepper
- **Make-ahead**: Soup keeps 3-4 days refrigerated; flavor deepens over time
- **Freezing**: Freezes well up to 3 months; thaw and reheat gently
- **Can serve chilled**: Like vichyssoise - refrigerate and serve cold
