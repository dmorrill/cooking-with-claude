# Steaming Vegetables at Altitude

Reference guide for steaming vegetables at 5,000+ feet elevation.

## Why Altitude Matters

- Water boils at lower temperature at altitude
- Lower boiling temp = slower cooking
- Add 1-2 minutes to standard sea-level steaming times

## Broccoli Steaming Times (5,000+ feet)

| Time | Result |
|------|--------|
| **7 minutes** | Very crisp, bright green, raw crunch still present |
| **8 minutes** | Crisp-tender, ideal for most dishes ⭐ *recommended* |
| **9 minutes** | Tender but not mushy, good for those who prefer softer |

## Testing for Doneness

- Insert fork or knife tip into thickest part of stem
- Should pierce easily but still have slight resistance
- Broccoli should be bright green, not olive/drab

## Pro Tips for Altitude Steaming

1. **Cut uniformly**: 1-1.5 inch pieces for even cooking
2. **Start checking at 7 minutes** to avoid overcooking
3. **Thick stems**: Slice lengthwise so they cook as fast as florets
4. **Use tight-fitting lid** to maintain steam pressure

## General Altitude Adjustments

| Vegetable | Sea Level | 5,000+ feet |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Broccoli | 5-7 min | 7-9 min |
| Asparagus | 3-5 min | 5-7 min |
| Green beans | 5-7 min | 7-9 min |
| Carrots | 7-10 min | 9-12 min |
| Cauliflower | 5-7 min | 7-9 min |

*Times are approximate - always check for doneness*
