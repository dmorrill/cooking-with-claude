### Instructions

#### 1. Toast the Rice (7 minutes) - CRUCIAL STEP
1. Heat oil in large pot over medium-high heat
2. Add rice and stir constantly for 5-7 minutes
3. Rice should turn golden and smell nutty
4. **Don't skip this**: Prevents mushy rice!

#### 2. Add Aromatics (3 minutes)
5. Add diced onion, cook 2 minutes
6. Add minced garlic, cook 30 seconds
7. Add tomato paste, stir for 1 minute until darkened

#### 3. Season and Simmer (20 minutes)
8. Add all spices, stir to coat rice evenly
9. Pour in broth all at once (it will sizzle!)
10. Bring to a rolling boil
11. Reduce heat to low, cover tightly
12. Simmer 18-20 minutes
13. **DO NOT lift lid or stir during cooking**

#### 4. Rest and Fluff (5 minutes)
14. Turn off heat, keep covered 5 minutes
15. Remove lid, fluff gently with fork
16. Add lime juice and cilantro if using
17. Taste and adjust salt

### Storage & Reheating

**Storage:**
- Refrigerator: 5 days in airtight container
- Freezer: Up to 3 months in portions

**Reheating:**
- Microwave: Add splash of water, cover, heat in intervals
- Stovetop: Pan-fry with oil for crispy rice
- Add fresh lime and cilantro after reheating

### Notes
- **Toasting is key**: Golden, nutty rice = fluffy texture
- **No peeking**: Lifting lid releases steam, makes rice mushy
- **Broth vs water**: Broth adds much more flavor
- **Tomato paste secret**: Cooking it briefly deepens flavor
- **Make-ahead friendly**: Actually improves after a day
- **Batch cooking**: Doubles easily for more meal prep
- **Variations**: Add corn, black beans, or diced peppers
