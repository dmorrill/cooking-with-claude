# Restaurant Staples & Multi-Use Components

This document tracks prepared components that serve multiple purposes across the restaurant menu and retail deli counter.

## Philosophy
Build a flexible kitchen system where staples can be:
- **Used across multiple menu items** (reduce prep complexity, consistent quality)
- **Sold retail at deli counter** (additional revenue stream, customer loyalty)
- **Batch-produced efficiently** (economies of scale, labor optimization)

- 16 oz containers (bulk for power users)
- Sample cups (1 oz) for tasting

#### Marketing Copy
*"Slow-cooked red peppers caramelized with miso for deep umami flavor. Spread on sandwiches, stir into soups, or mix with warm water for instant broth. Vegan. Low-oil. Made in-house."*

#### Cross-selling Opportunities
- Pair with fresh bread from bakery
- Suggest uses: "Try it on our Leek & Basil Sandwich!"
- Recipe cards with creative applications

#### Production Schedule
- **Prep day**: Monday & Thursday (2x weekly production)
- **Batch size**: 6x (fills ~24 retail jars + kitchen stock)
- **Shelf life management**: FIFO rotation, date labels

---

### Production Notes & Tips

#### Equipment Needed (Large Batches)
- Heavy-bottomed pan or Dutch oven (6+ quart capacity for 3x batch)
- Two pans recommended for 6x batch
- Food processor (12+ cup capacity)
- Portioning containers or jars
- Labels

#### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Catching/burning**: Add water splashes more frequently in larger batches
- **Uneven caramelization**: Stir more often, ensure even heat distribution
- **Too thick**: Add warm water or vegetable broth during processing
- **Too thin**: Simmer longer uncovered to reduce moisture

#### Prep Efficiency Tips
- Use food processor to chop vegetables quickly
- Prep multiple batches of vegetables, cook in sequence
- Cool completely before jarring to prevent condensation
- Label immediately with date and batch number

### 🌾🍁 Buttermilk Maple-Butter Dinner Rolls with Wheat Germ

**Status**: Testing phase
**Category**: Baked goods, Bread service
**Serving size**: 4 rolls (scales easily)
**Timeline**: Prep 15 min • Rise 1 hr • Bake 18-20 min at 375°F
**Total time**: ~1 hr 45 min

#### Recipe Overview
Tender dinner rolls with subtle maple sweetness and nutty wheat germ. Buttermilk adds tang and tenderness. Finished with maple-butter glaze and flaky salt.

#### Ingredients (4 rolls)

**Dough:**
- 1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour
- 2 Tbsp (15g) toasted wheat germ
- ¼ tsp salt
- ⅛ tsp baking soda (balances buttermilk acidity)
- ¾ tsp active dry yeast (≈¼ packet)
- 2 tsp (10g) pure maple syrup
- ⅓ cup minus 1 tsp (≈75ml) warm cultured reduced-fat buttermilk (no warmer than 100°F)
- 1 Tbsp (14g) unsalted butter, melted (+ more for brushing)
- 1 small egg, beaten — use ½ (≈1 Tbsp) for dough, save rest for egg wash

**Topping:**
- 1-2 tsp toasted wheat germ (for sprinkling)
- Reserved beaten egg or melted butter (for brushing)

**Maple-Butter Glaze:**
- 1 tsp pure maple syrup
- 1 tsp melted butter
- Pinch flaky salt (optional)

#### Instructions

1. **Activate yeast**: Combine warm buttermilk and maple syrup in small bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top and let sit 5-10 min until foamy.

2. **Mix dough**: In medium bowl, whisk flour, wheat germ, salt, and baking soda. Add yeast mixture, melted butter, and half the beaten egg. Stir until shaggy dough forms.

3. **Knead**: Knead 5-7 min by hand or 4-5 min in mixer until smooth and slightly tacky. Add 1-2 tsp flour if sticky or a few drops warm buttermilk if stiff.

4. **First rise**: Place in lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in warm spot until doubled — about 1 hour.

5. **Shape**: Punch down dough and divide into 4 pieces. Shape each into smooth ball and arrange in greased 6-inch round or small loaf pan.

6. **Second rise**: Cover and let rise 25-30 min until puffy.

7. **Topping & bake**: Brush tops with reserved egg or melted butter, then sprinkle wheat germ evenly over each roll. Bake at 375°F for 18-20 min, until golden and internal temp reads 190°F.

8. **Glaze & finish**: Mix maple syrup and melted butter for glaze. Brush onto hot rolls right after baking and sprinkle lightly with flaky salt. Cool 10 min before serving warm.

#### Restaurant Considerations

**Potential menu applications:**
- Bread service with dinner entrées
- Brunch offering (pair with compound butters)
- "Baker's basket" with assorted breads
- À la carte add-on

**Scaling notes:**
- Recipe scales linearly (4 → 8 → 12 → 16 rolls)
- Consider batch production: make dough in morning, shape and bake throughout service
- Second rise can be refrigerated overnight for next-day baking

**Cost analysis:** (TBD)
- Calculate per-roll ingredient cost
- Labor time for batch production
- Pricing comparison to other bread offerings

**Storage & service:**
- Best served warm from oven
- Can be reheated (5 min at 350°F)
- Consider par-baking for quick finish during service

**Customer appeal factors:**
- Seasonal (maple, wheat germ = fall/winter vibes)
- Local ingredients (Vermont maple syrup?)
- Unique twist on classic dinner roll
- Instagram-worthy presentation with wheat germ topping

**Testing notes:**
- **Trial 1 (2025-10-29)**: Dough didn't rise enough, resulting in slightly chewy texture
  - Possible fixes:
    - Extend first rise beyond 1 hour (watch for true doubling in size, not just time)
    - Ensure warm rising environment (75-80°F ideal)
    - Check yeast freshness/activation
    - Consider slightly more yeast for more reliable rise
    - Ensure buttermilk isn't too warm (>100°F can kill yeast)

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Test larger batch (12-16 rolls)
- [ ] Calculate accurate food cost
- [ ] Test par-bake and reheat method
- [ ] Get customer feedback on flavor profile
- [ ] Develop compound butter pairings
- [ ] Test with different flours (whole wheat ratio?)
