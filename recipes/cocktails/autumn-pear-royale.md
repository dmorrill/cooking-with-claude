## Tasting Notes

- **Effervescent and crisp** from the sparkling cider
- **Honeyed richness** from Sauternes balanced by dry bubbles
- **Aromatic pear complexity** without overwhelming
- **Elegant and sophisticated** - perfect for special occasions

## Notes

- **Stir, don't shake**: Stirring keeps cocktail clear; shaking creates cloudiness
- **Chill everything**: Cold ingredients = less ice dilution = concentrated flavor
- **Sparkling cider choice**: Use clear, crisp, dry cider (not sweet or cloudy)
- **Sauternes**: Honeyed, apricot-like sweetness is key to character
- **Pear brandy**: Use clear eau de vie (not aged brandy) for pure pear essence
- **Ratio adjustment**: For lighter drink, use 0.5 oz brandy, 1 oz Sauternes, 5 oz cider
- **Gentle bubbles**: Add cider last, stir minimally to preserve carbonation

## Perfect For

- Fall celebrations
- Holiday aperitifs
- Special occasions
- Elegant dinner parties
