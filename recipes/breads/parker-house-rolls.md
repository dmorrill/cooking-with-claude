## Ingredients

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| All-purpose flour | ¾ cup (90g) + more for dusting |
| Instant yeast | ¾ tsp (2g) |
| Granulated sugar | 2¼ tsp (10g) |
| Salt | ⅓ tsp (2g) |
| Baking soda | ⅛ tsp (pinch) |
| Unsalted butter (room temp) | 2¼ tsp (11g) |
| Unsalted butter (melted, for brushing) | 1 Tbsp (14g) |
| Buttermilk (room temp) | ¼ cup (57g) |
| Large egg | 1 Tbsp beaten (~¼ egg) |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Mix Dough (5 minutes)
1. Combine flour, instant yeast, sugar, salt, and baking soda in small bowl
2. Add room-temperature butter, buttermilk, and beaten egg
3. Stir with wooden spoon until shaggy dough forms

### Step 2: Knead (10 minutes by hand)
4. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface
5. Knead until smooth and elastic (soft and slightly tacky, not sticky)
6. **Altitude check**: If dough feels stiff, add 1-2 tsp more buttermilk

### Step 3: First Rise (60-75 minutes at altitude)
7. Lightly grease a small bowl with butter
8. Place dough in bowl and cover
9. Let rise in warm spot until puffy (watch visual cues, not clock)

### Step 4: Shape Rolls (10 minutes)
10. Roll dough into a 4" x 6" rectangle on clean, dry surface
11. Brush entire surface with melted butter
12. Cut lengthwise into two 2" x 6" strips
13. Fold each strip so bottom edge extends ½" beyond top (signature fold)
14. Cut each folded strip into 2 pieces for 4 rolls total

### Step 5: Second Rise (30-45 minutes)
15. Arrange rolls in greased 6-inch pan, flip smooth-side up
16. Brush with remaining butter and cover
17. Let rise until puffy and touching

### Step 6: Bake (20-25 minutes at 365°F)
18. Preheat oven to 365°F (altitude adjusted)
19. Bake until golden brown (internal temp 190°F)
20. Brush with butter immediately and cool 5 minutes

## Notes

- **The fold**: ½" overhang creates beautiful layers and prevents popping open
- **Room temp ingredients**: Critical for proper yeast activation
- **Buttermilk substitution**: Adds tenderness and tang
- **Don't over-proof**: At altitude, dough rises faster and can collapse
- **Storage**: Airtight container 2-3 days, or freeze up to 2 months
- **Scaling**: Recipe scales linearly (4 → 8 → 12 → 16 rolls)

## Altitude Adjustments (5,280 ft)

- **Faster rise times**: 25-35% faster than sea level
- **Higher oven temp**: 365°F vs 350°F at sea level
- **Visual markers trump timers**: "Puffy and touching" = ready to bake
