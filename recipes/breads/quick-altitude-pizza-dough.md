# Quick Altitude Pizza Dough
- **Prep Time**: 10 minutes
- **Rise Time**: 20-40 minutes (faster at altitude)
- **Total Time**: 45-60 minutes (including baking)
- **Yield**: 1 large pizza or 2 medium pizzas
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Type**: Dinner/Base Recipe
- **Source**: Personal method, optimized for high altitude

### Ingredients
- [ ] **Warm water** (~1 cup) - *Location: tap water*
- [ ] **Active dry or instant yeast** (~2 Tbsp, generous amount for fast rise) - *Location: pantry/fridge*
- [ ] **Maple syrup** (dollop, ~1 Tbsp) - *Location: pantry*
- [ ] **Semolina flour** (1¼ cups) - *Location: pantry*
- [ ] **All-purpose flour** (⅓ cup+, add by feel) - *Location: pantry*

### Equipment
- [ ] **Pizza stone** - *preheat in oven*
- [ ] **Parchment paper** - *for easy transfer*
- [ ] **Pizza spatula/peel** - *for transferring to oven*

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Activate Yeast
1. Combine ~1 cup warm water, ~2 Tbsp yeast, and a dollop of maple syrup in a bowl
2. Stir and let activate briefly (yeast will start to foam)

#### Step 2: Preheat Oven
3. Place pizza stone in oven and preheat to **550°F**
4. Let stone preheat for at least 30-45 minutes for best results

#### Step 3: Mix Dough
5. Add **1¼ cups semolina flour** to the yeast mixture and stir
6. Add **⅓ cup all-purpose flour** to start
7. Continue adding AP flour gradually until dough is slightly sticky but workable

#### Step 4: Knead and Develop Gluten
8. Work the dough by hand, kneading until gluten begins to form
9. Dough should become smooth and elastic (slightly sticky is okay)
10. Knead for 3-5 minutes total

#### Step 5: Rise
11. Cover bowl with clean towel or plastic wrap
12. Let rise in warm spot until doubled in size (20-40 minutes at altitude)
13. Meanwhile, prep your toppings

#### Step 6: Shape and Bake
14. Shape dough into a round directly on a piece of parchment paper
15. Add your toppings
16. Use pizza spatula to transfer pizza AND parchment paper onto the preheated stone
17. **Turn oven down to 350°F** once pizza goes in
18. Bake until cheese has little bits of golden edges (typically 12-18 minutes)

### Notes
- **Altitude optimization**: Extra yeast (2 Tbsp) compensates for faster rise at high altitude
- **Maple syrup**: Feeds the yeast for faster activation and adds subtle sweetness
- **Semolina flour**: Provides excellent chew, crispy texture, and helps prevent sticking
- **Slightly sticky dough**: Don't over-flour - slightly sticky dough = better texture
- **Gluten development**: Work the dough enough to feel it become elastic and smooth
- **Parchment paper trick**: Makes transfer foolproof, prevents sticking, can slide right onto stone
- **Temperature drop**: Starting at 550°F preheats the stone thoroughly, then 350°F prevents burning
- **Visual doneness cue**: Golden edges on cheese = perfectly baked
- **Timing varies**: Rise time depends on altitude and room temperature - check for doubled size, not clock
- **Flour ratio**: ~2:1 semolina to AP flour, but adjust AP by feel for right texture
