### Ingredients
- [ ] **All-purpose flour** (1/2 cup) - *Location: pantry*
- [ ] **Milk** (1/2 cup, whole milk preferred) - *Location: refrigerator*
- [ ] **Large eggs** (2) - *Location: refrigerator*
- [ ] **Fine salt** (pinch) - *Location: pantry*
- [ ] **Beef drippings or neutral oil** (for muffin tin) - *Location: reserve from roast beef or use pantry oil*

### Equipment
- [ ] **Muffin tin** (6-cup or 12-cup)
- [ ] **Whisk**
- [ ] **Measuring cups**
- [ ] **Mixing bowl**

### Instructions

#### 1. Make the Batter (30 minutes to overnight ahead)
1. Whisk together flour, milk, eggs, and a pinch of salt until completely smooth
2. Cover and rest at room temperature for **at least 30 minutes** (or refrigerate overnight)
3. **Critical:** Batter must rest for proper rise

#### 2. Prepare the Tin
1. Preheat oven to **425°F (220°C)**
2. Add a small amount of beef drippings (or neutral oil) to each muffin cavity
3. Place tin in oven and heat until fat is **smoking hot** (8-10 minutes)
4. **Safety note:** Fat should be extremely hot but not burning

#### 3. Bake the Puddings
1. Working quickly, remove hot tin from oven
2. Pour batter into hot cavities (fill about halfway)
3. Immediately return to oven
4. Bake **18-22 minutes**, completely undisturbed
5. **Do not open oven door** - puddings will collapse
6. Puddings should be puffed, crispy, and deep golden brown

#### 4. Serve
Serve immediately with roast beef and horseradish crème fraîche

### Notes

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Hot fat is key:** Oil/drippings must be smoking before adding batter
- **Don't open oven:** Opening the door causes puddings to deflate
- **Rested batter:** Minimum 30 minutes rest improves texture
- **Serve immediately:** Yorkshire puddings deflate as they cool

**Make-Ahead:**
- Make batter the night before and refrigerate (bring to room temp before baking)
- Puddings must be baked and served immediately - cannot be made ahead

**Variations:**
- Use all beef drippings for most authentic flavor
- **Cast iron skillet method:** Can make one large pudding, but requires ripping hot fat - results in flatter, Dutch baby-style pudding

**Milk Substitution:**
- 6 tbsp unsweetened soy milk + 2 tbsp heavy cream = works great

**Lessons Learned:**
- Attempted cast iron skillet method - pudding was tasty but flat (pancake-shaped)
- Fat wasn't hot enough - didn't get violent sizzle when batter hit pan
- **Verdict:** Get a proper muffin tin for individual puddings that puff
- Neutral oil works well for cleaner taste
- Can make in popover pan for taller puddings

**Pairing:**
- Essential with roast beef
- Serve with au jus for dipping
- Horseradish crème fraîche adds tangy contrast

**Holiday Timeline:**
- Day before: Make batter, refrigerate overnight
- Day of: Bring batter to room temp, preheat oven, heat fat in tin, bake puddings
- Serve immediately with roast beef
