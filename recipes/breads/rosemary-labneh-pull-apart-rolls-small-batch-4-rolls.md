### Instructions

#### Step 1: Activate Yeast (10 minutes) ⚠️ CRITICAL!
1. Warm scant 2.5 Tbsp water to 100-110°F (should feel warm on wrist, NOT hot)
2. Add 1 tsp yeast + ½ tsp sugar to warm water, stir gently
3. **WAIT 5-10 minutes for FOAM** - mixture should become foamy/bubbly on top
4. **❌ NO FOAM = DEAD YEAST** - do not proceed, get fresh yeast and start over

#### Step 2: Prep Herbs (5-10 minutes)
5. Strip leaves from herb stems (rosemary, thyme, sage)
6. Pile all herbs together and chop finely
7. Weigh as you chop: 9g rosemary, 5g thyme, 3g sage, 9g parsley (~26g total)
8. Mix all chopped herbs together
9. **Reserve 4g (~1.5 Tbsp) mixed herbs** in small bowl for topping later
10. Remaining ~22g herbs will go in dough

#### Step 3: Mix Wet Ingredients (5 minutes)
11. In large bowl, whisk together: 3 Tbsp labneh (room temp), 2 Tbsp milk (room temp), 1 Tbsp + 2 tsp beaten egg, 1¾ Tbsp melted butter (cooled), 1 tsp sugar
12. Add foamy yeast mixture and whisk to combine

#### Step 4: Mix Dry Ingredients (3 minutes)
13. In separate bowl, combine: ⅞ cup White Sonora flour (hold back 2 Tbsp reserve), ⅓ cup rye flour, ½ tsp salt, ¼ tsp black pepper
14. Whisk dry ingredients together

#### Step 5: Combine Everything (5 minutes)
15. Pour wet mixture into dry ingredients
16. Add ~22g mixed herbs (not the reserved topping herbs)
17. Stir with wooden spoon until shaggy dough forms
18. **Check consistency:** Should be soft and slightly tacky, NOT wet or sticky
19. If too wet, add RESERVED flour 1 tsp at a time

#### Step 6: Knead (6-7 minutes by stand mixer, 8-10 minutes by hand)
**Stand mixer method:**
20. Place dough in mixer bowl with dough hook
21. Knead on medium-low speed (speed 2-3) for 6-7 minutes
22. Dough should pull away from sides and form ball around hook

**By hand method:**
23. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface
24. Knead using push-fold-turn method for 8-10 minutes

**What you're looking for:**
- **SATINY, smooth texture** - NOT sticky!
- Should be **barely tacky** when touched
- Springs back when poked
- Herbs distributed throughout

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Dough texture must be SATINY and smooth, not sticky or wet. This is the key to success!**

#### Step 7: First Rise (60-75 minutes at altitude)
25. Butter a clean bowl generously
26. Place dough in bowl
27. **Cover TIGHTLY** (plastic wrap + damp towel for dry climates)
28. Rise in warm, draft-free spot for 60-75 minutes until doubled
29. **At altitude, check at 60 minutes** - better slightly under-proofed than over
30. **Test if ready:** Poke with finger - if indent stays, it's ready

#### Step 8: Shape Rolls (10 minutes)
31. Grease 6" springform pan with butter
32. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface
33. Divide into 4 equal pieces (~45-50g each)
34. Roll each piece into smooth ball by cupping hand and rolling in circles
35. **Arrange in 6" pan:** 1 roll in CENTER + 3 rolls around EDGE, evenly spaced
36. Rolls should be touching or nearly touching

#### Step 9: Second Rise (35-45 minutes at altitude)
37. Cover pan tightly (plastic wrap + damp towel)
38. Rise in warm spot for 35-45 minutes until puffy and touching
39. **Check at 35 minutes** - rolls should fill pan and be touching
40. **Better slightly under-proofed than over-proofed at altitude!**

#### Step 10: Preheat Oven (10 minutes before baking)
41. At 25-minute mark of second rise, preheat oven to **395-400°F** (high temp for altitude)

#### Step 11: Brush & Top (2-3 minutes)
42. Mix 1.5 Tbsp melted butter + 1½ tsp olive oil (optional)
43. Brush generously over risen rolls
44. Sprinkle **reserved 4g herb mix** on top
45. Add flaky sea salt
46. Gently press herbs into surface

#### Step 12: Bake (25-28 minutes) ⚠️ LONGER THAN EXPECTED!
47. Remove plastic wrap
48. Bake **25-28 minutes** until deeply golden brown
49. **Internal temperature must reach 190-200°F** - use thermometer!
50. If browning too fast, tent with foil after 20 minutes
51. **The 6" pan creates thicker rolls that need LONGER baking than expected**

#### Step 13: Finish and Serve (5 minutes)
52. Remove from oven and immediately brush with remaining melted butter
53. Cool in pan 5 minutes
54. Release springform ring and slide onto serving plate
55. **Serve warm** - let guests pull apart individual rolls!

### Serving Suggestions

- Herb butter on the side
- Perfect for soaking up turkey gravy
- Great with soups and stews
- Beautiful centerpiece for the table

### Notes & Tips

**⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS (learned from first batch):**
- **DOUGH TEXTURE IS EVERYTHING:** Must be satiny and smooth, NOT sticky or wet. This determines success!
- **REDUCED LIQUIDS:** Original recipe had too much liquid - reduced labneh and milk by ⅓
- **LONGER BAKING:** 6" pan = thicker rolls = need 25-28 min (not 18-22 min)
- **INTERNAL TEMP:** Must hit 190-200°F or rolls will be dense and wet inside
- **YEAST ACTIVATION:** If yeast doesn't foam, DO NOT PROCEED - get fresh yeast

**Altitude Adjustments (5,280 ft - high altitude):**
- **Faster rise times:** 60-75 min first rise, 35-45 min second rise (watch visual cues!)
- **Higher oven temp:** 395-400°F helps set structure before over-expansion
- **Don't over-proof:** Most critical at altitude - over-proofed dough collapses
- **Keep dough covered:** Dry air will form skin on dough surface
- **Visual markers trump timers:** "Puffy and touching" more reliable than clock

**Herb Notes:**
- **¾ cup herbs is A LOT** - these are intensely aromatic!
- Three butter applications (before bake, after bake, when serving) = maximum flavor
- Rosemary is the bold backbone - chop finely to avoid woody pieces
- Parsley adds brightness and color

**Dough Texture Checkpoints:**
- **After mixing:** Shaggy but not soupy
- **After kneading:** SATINY, smooth, barely tacky - NOT sticky
- **Windowpane test:** Stretch small piece - should form thin membrane without tearing
- **If too wet during kneading:** Add reserve flour 1 Tbsp at a time

**Storage & Reheating:**
- Store in airtight container at room temp for 2-3 days
- Freeze up to 2 months
- Reheat: Warm in 300°F oven for 5-7 minutes, or microwave 15-20 seconds

**Lessons Learned:**
- First attempt: Used original liquid amounts (4 Tbsp + 1 tsp labneh, 3.5 Tbsp milk) - resulted in wet, dense rolls
- **Fix:** Reduce labneh to 3 Tbsp, milk to 2 Tbsp - creates satiny dough texture
- First attempt: Baked 18-22 min - under-baked, wet inside
- **Fix:** Bake 25-28 min until internal temp 190-200°F

### Why These Are Special
- **Pull-apart presentation:** Stunning on the table, fun to serve
- **Bold herb garden flavor:** Rosemary, thyme, sage, parsley - full herb experience
- **Tangy labneh:** Adds moisture and complexity
- **Earthy rye:** Complements the herbs beautifully
- **Altitude-optimized:** Actually works at high elevation!
- **Perfect for holiday dinners or special occasions**
