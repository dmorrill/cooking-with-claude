## Notes

- **Soul food heritage**: Sweet potato is quintessential - adds luscious mouthfeel
- **Dough texture**: Should be slightly sticky but workable
- **Shaping technique**: Circular motion creates surface tension for beautiful rounds
- **Even sizing**: Use kitchen scale (65g each) for uniform rolls
- **Storage**: Room temp 2-3 days, freeze up to 2 months
- **Make-ahead**: Refrigerate after first rise overnight, continue next day
