Weekly meal planning workflows and templates to reduce decision fatigue and food waste.

## Weekly Planning Workflow

### Sunday Planning Session (15-20 min)

1. **Review Current Inventory**
   - Check what's expiring this week
   - Note proteins in freezer that need to be used
   - See what produce needs to be eaten first

2. **Plan the Week**
   - Assign meals to days based on schedule
   - Balance quick meals (busy days) with longer ones (relaxed days)
   - Consider batch cooking opportunities

3. **Generate Shopping List**
   - List missing ingredients for planned meals
   - Add weekly staples running low
   - Organize by store section

## Planning Strategies

### Theme Nights
Reduce decision fatigue by assigning themes:
- **Meatless Monday**: Vegetarian dishes
- **Taco Tuesday**: Mexican-inspired
- **Stir-Fry Friday**: Quick Asian dishes
- **Sunday Project**: More elaborate cooking

### Batch Cooking
Cook once, eat twice:
- Double protein portions for next day's lunch
- Make big batch of grains for multiple meals
- Prep vegetables for several recipes at once

### Flex Meals
Plan 5 meals for 7 days:
- Leaves room for leftovers
- Allows for spontaneous dining out
- Reduces food waste from over-planning
