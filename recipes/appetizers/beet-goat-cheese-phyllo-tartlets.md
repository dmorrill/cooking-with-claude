### Instructions

#### 1. Roast the Beet (If Using Raw - Can be done 2-3 days ahead)
1. Wrap beet in foil and roast at **400°F (205°C)** until tender (45-60 minutes)
2. Cool completely, peel, and dice very finely
3. **Make-ahead:** Store roasted beet in refrigerator for up to 2-3 days

#### 2. Make the Filling (Up to 24 hours ahead)
1. In a bowl, combine goat cheese, diced beet, lemon zest, olive oil, salt, and pepper
2. Mix gently until cohesive but still textured (smooth enough to pipe, with visible beet pieces)
3. Taste and adjust seasoning
4. **Make-ahead:** Refrigerate in airtight container for up to 24 hours

#### 3. Prepare Phyllo Shells (Day Of)
1. Keep shells frozen until ready to use
2. Optional: Re-crisp shells by baking at **350°F (175°C)** for 3-5 minutes
3. Cool completely before filling

#### 4. Assembly (2-4 hours before serving)

### Notes

**Timing & Storage:**
- **Filling:** Make up to 24 hours ahead, refrigerated
- **Phyllo shells:** Keep frozen until day-of
- **Assembled tartlets:** Best assembled 2-4 hours before serving
- **Roasted beet:** Can be prepared 2-3 days in advance

**Plating:**
- Use light-colored platter to highlight the vibrant beet color
- Keep garnishes restrained — visual impact comes from filling itself
- Look especially beautiful alongside green elements (endive, herbs)

**Texture Goal:**
- Smooth enough to pipe, with visible beet pieces for color
- Goat cheese should be soft enough to mix easily

**Variations:**
- Add **champagne vinegar** instead of lemon zest for sharper note
- Substitute goat cheese with whipped feta for saltier profile
- **Dairy-free:** Use whipped cashew cheese with lemon and olive oil

**Pairing:**
- Excellent with **Champagne** (especially Brut or Blanc de Blancs)
- Complements smoked salmon blini and caviar service without competing

**Holiday Timeline:**
- 2-3 days ahead: Roast beet
- Day before: Make filling
- Day of (afternoon): Assemble tartlets during cold canapé assembly
- Serve with Champagne
