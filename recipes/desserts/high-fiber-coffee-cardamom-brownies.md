- [ ] **Food processor** (for black beans, pistachios, oats)
- [ ] **Stand mixer or hand mixer** (for eggs + sugar)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prep (5 min)
1. Preheat oven to **370°F** (altitude-adjusted from 350°F)
2. Grease 8-inch square pan with butter
3. Line with parchment paper with overhang on 2 sides
4. Lightly butter the parchment

### Step 2: Prepare Ingredients (10 min)
5. **Black beans**: Drain and rinse canned black beans, purée in food processor until completely smooth (no chunks!)
6. **Pistachios + oats**: Grind together in food processor to fine meal (stop before they become paste)
7. **Dry mix**: Combine rye flour, wheat germ, ground pistachios, ground oats in bowl
8. Set aside

### Step 3: Melt & Enrich Chocolate (5 min)
9. Melt butter + chocolate in pot over low heat (or microwave in 15-second intervals)
10. Once melted and smooth, whisk in: espresso granules, vanilla, cardamom, cinnamon, salt
11. Whisk in: cocoa powder (mix until smooth and glossy)
12. Whisk in: all date paste/syrup
13. Whisk in: black bean purée (should be completely smooth)
14. Whisk in: ground flaxseed
15. Whisk in: molasses
16. Whisk in: **3 tbsp warm water** to start (have extra ready)
17. Mixture should be smooth, glossy, and warm (not hot)
18. Set aside to cool slightly

### Step 4: Mix Eggs + Sugar (1 min)
19. In bowl, combine: 4 eggs + 6 tbsp sugar
20. **Whisk together just until combined** (~30 seconds)
21. No need to aerate - we want dense, fudgy texture (not cake-like)
22. Mixture will be uniform yellow color

**Note**: Original recipe whipped eggs 3-4 min, but testers found this created too cake-like/fluffy texture. Skip the whipping for traditional fudgy brownies!

### Step 5: Combine Wet Ingredients (2 min)
23. Pour warm (not hot) chocolate mixture into eggs
24. **Whisk or stir** until fully combined and glossy
25. No need to fold gently - we're not preserving air bubbles

### Step 6: Add Dry Mix (2 min)
26. Add dry mix (rye flour, wheat germ, ground pistachios, ground oats)
27. Fold with gentle, broad strokes until no flour streaks remain
28. Check consistency: should be thick but pourable (like thick pancake batter)
29. If very stiff, add 1 more tbsp warm water and fold gently
30. Do NOT overmix!

### Step 7: Bake (50-55 min at altitude)
31. Pour batter into prepared pan
32. Spread evenly with spatula
33. Bake at **370°F** on middle rack
34. Check at **45 minutes** (dense batter takes longer than typical brownies)
35. **Doneness test**: Insert toothpick in center
    - Should have **moist, fudgy crumbs** (NOT clean, NOT wet batter)
    - Top should look set and slightly crackled
36. If still liquid at 45 min, bake 3-4 more minutes and check again
37. **Total bake time: 50-55 minutes** (tested at 5,280 ft altitude)

### Step 8: Cool & Cut (60+ min)
38. Remove from oven and cool in pan on wire rack
39. Cool **at least 1 hour** (preferably 2 hours for cleanest cuts)
40. Use parchment overhang to lift brownies out of pan
41. Cut into 9 squares with sharp knife
42. Wipe knife clean between cuts for neat edges

## Notes

**Altitude Adjustments (5,280 feet):**
- Increased oven temp: 350°F → 370°F (faster crust formation)
- Increased eggs: 3 → 4 (more structure and moisture)
- Increased water: 1 tbsp → 3-4 tbsp (combat evaporation)
- Increased sugar: 4 tbsp → 6 tbsp (helps structure and sweetness balance)
- **Bake time: 50-55 minutes at 370°F** (TESTED: Dense batter needs much longer than expected. Check at 45 min, then every 3-4 min until toothpick has moist crumbs)

**Flavor Profile:**
- Persian pastry inspiration: pistachios + cardamom + coffee
- Extra cocoa brings intensity and balances date sweetness
- Molasses adds depth without extra sugar
- Black beans invisible in flavor, add moisture and fiber

**Texture Engineering:**
- Black beans + flax + pistachios = moisture retention (stays fudgy even when chilled)
- Rye flour has gluten structure to hold everything together
- Ground oats add structure without noticeable texture
- 4 eggs crucial for altitude structure
- Goal: Fudgy, not cakey or dense

**Fiber Breakdown (~3.4-3.6g per brownie):**
- Black beans: ~7.5g per pan
- Rye flour: ~5g per pan
- Date paste: ~3-4g per pan
- Cocoa (4 tbsp): ~6g per pan
- Pistachios: ~4g per pan
- Flaxseed: ~2.8g per pan
- Rolled oats: ~1.3g per pan
- Wheat germ: ~1g per pan
- **Total: ~31-32g fiber per pan (9 brownies)**

**✅ Tested Results (5,280 ft altitude):**
- **Bake time**: 53 minutes at 370°F (much longer than estimated 35-40 min)
- **Texture**: Soft and luscious
  - **IMPORTANT**: First batch whipped eggs 3-4 min → too cake-y/fluffy (tester feedback)
  - **UPDATED**: Recipe now uses just-whisked eggs (no whipping) for traditional fudgy brownie texture
  - For more fudgy texture: Skip egg whipping, just whisk to combine (~30 sec)
- **Sweetness**: Not super sweet (6 tbsp sugar good, could bump to 7-8 for sweeter preference)
- **Coffee flavor**: Not directly detectable but adds depth
- **Cardamom**: Comes through nicely, well-balanced spicing
- **Bean flavor**: Completely undetectable - SUCCESS
- **Verdict**: Would make again! Keeper recipe (with no-whip egg method).
- **Note**: Ground flax seeds with mortar & pestle worked great (added to dry ingredients instead of wet)

**Storage:**
- Room temp: 2-3 days in airtight container
- Refrigerated: 5-7 days (will firm up, still delicious)
- Frozen: 3 months (wrap individually in plastic wrap, then foil)

**Tips:**
- Grind cardamom fresh from pods for boldest flavor (mortar & pestle or rolling pin)
- Black bean purée must be completely smooth or you'll have chunks in brownies
- Don't overgrind pistachios - stop at fine meal, not paste/butter
- Sugar reduction is aggressive - dates + molasses provide sweetness
- Extra egg and water are critical at altitude
- Toothpick should have moist crumbs, NOT be clean (key to fudgy texture)

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Batter too stiff**: Add 1 more tbsp warm water
- **Batter too thin**: That's okay, beans thicken as they bake
- **Top not setting after 35 min**: Bake 5 more minutes
- **Edges browning too fast**: Cover edges with foil strip
- **Too dense/gummy**: Likely overbaked or needed more liquid
- **Not sweet enough**: Increase sugar to 8 tbsp next time
- **Bean flavor detectable**: Make sure beans are rinsed well and purée is smooth

**Experimental Recipe Notes:**
This is a heavily modified version with multiple substitutions. First bake may require adjustments. Document your results for future iterations!
