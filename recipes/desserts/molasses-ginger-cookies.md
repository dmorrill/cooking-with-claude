### Instructions

#### Step 1: Make the Wet Mix (2 min)
1. In a medium bowl, whisk together oil (or butter), brown sugar, molasses, egg, and vanilla
2. Whisk until glossy and fully combined

#### Step 2: Whisk Dry Ingredients (2 min)
3. In a separate bowl, combine flour, ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, baking soda, and salt
4. Whisk to distribute spices evenly

#### Step 3: Combine Wet + Dry (3 min)
5. Add dry ingredients to wet mixture
6. Fold gently with spatula until no dry streaks remain
7. **If dough is very soft**: Add 1-3 tbsp flour (AP or rye), 1 tbsp at a time, until dough becomes softly scoopable

#### Step 4: Chill the Dough (30 min - 48 hours)
8. Cover dough with plastic wrap pressed directly onto surface
9. Refrigerate at least 30 minutes and up to 48 hours

#### Step 5: Bake (8-10 min)
10. Preheat oven to **350°F (175°C)**
11. Line baking sheet with parchment paper
12. Scoop 1-1.5 tbsp portions of dough and roll into smooth balls
13. Place on sheet with space to spread
14. Gently press tops to slightly flatten
15. Bake for **8-10 minutes** until edges are set and tops show cracks
16. Cool 5 minutes on tray, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely before icing

#### Step 6: Decorate (1-6 hours later)
17. **For Simple Glaze**: Whisk together powdered sugar, plant milk, vanilla, and optional lemon until smooth
18. **For Vegan Royal Icing**: Whisk together powdered sugar, aquafaba, and lemon juice until smooth and thick
19. Decorate cookies once fully cooled (1-6 hours after baking)
20. Add food coloring if desired

### Notes

**Dough Consistency:**
- Dough should be softly scoopable after chilling, not sticky
- If too wet before chilling, add extra flour 1 tbsp at a time
- Chilling is essential for proper texture and preventing spreading

**Egg Adjustment:**
- Recipe calls for "lightly beaten" egg
- If dough seems too wet, use only ~¾ of the beaten egg
- Save remaining egg for egg wash on other recipes

**Flavor Variation:**
- Rye flour option adds deeper, earthier molasses flavor
- Can substitute up to ¼ cup AP flour with rye (not more or cookies may be dense)

**Make-Ahead:**
- **Dough**: Can be chilled up to 48 hours before baking
- **Dough balls**: Can be frozen and baked later (add 1-2 minutes to bake time)
- **Baked cookies**: Store at room temperature 3-4 days in airtight container

**Perfect for Decorating:**
- Soft, chewy texture
- Smooth surface ideal for icing
- Press dough balls slightly flat before baking for smoother tops
- Let cool completely before decorating (1-6 hours)

**Icing Tips:**
- Simple glaze is best for flooding/covering entire cookie
- Royal icing is better for detailed piping and designs
- Add food coloring drop by drop to achieve desired shade
- Lemon brightens the sweetness and adds complexity

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Dough too sticky to scoop**: Chill longer or add 1-2 tbsp more flour
- **Cookies spread too much**: Dough wasn't chilled long enough, or oven temp too low
- **Cookies too hard**: Overbaked - reduce time by 1-2 minutes next batch
- **Tops too cracked**: Normal for ginger cookies, embrace the rustic look!
- **Icing too thick**: Add more liquid 1 tsp at a time
- **Icing too thin**: Add more powdered sugar 1 tbsp at a time
