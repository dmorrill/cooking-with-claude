### Make-Ahead Timeline

#### Day 1 (Evening):
1. **Make dough**:
   - Activate yeast in warm buttermilk with sugar (5 min)
   - Mix dough in stand mixer (10 min)
   - First rise in buttered bowl (1 hour)
   - Refrigerate (1+ hours or overnight)

2. **Assemble rolls**:
   - Make topping: Cook maple syrup mixture, pour in pan, add pecans
   - Make filling: Mix sugar and spices
   - Roll dough, spread butter, add filling
   - Cut into 12 pieces, place in pan
   - Cover and refrigerate until baking day

#### Day 2 (Baking Day):
3. **Rise and bake**:
   - Remove from fridge, let rise 1-2 hours until puffy
   - Bake at 350°F for 30-35 minutes
   - Cool 5 minutes, flip onto serving tray
   - Serve warm

### Key Techniques

**Dough Success:**
- Buttermilk should be exactly 100°F for yeast
- Dough is ready when billowy and clearing sides of bowl
- Add flour gradually if too sticky (up to 4 Tbsp extra)

**Assembly Tips:**
- Roll dough to ¼-inch thickness (12x16 rectangle)
- Leave 1 inch unbuttered edge for sealing
- Use dental floss for clean cuts (slide under, cross over, pull)

**The Flip:**
- Must flip within 5 minutes or caramel hardens
- Run knife around edges first
- Place tray on top, flip decisively
- If caramel sticks, warm pan briefly

### Storage & Notes
- **Fresh**: Best served warm day of baking
- **Reheat**: Microwave 15-20 seconds per roll
- **Make-ahead**: Can refrigerate assembled rolls up to 24 hours
- **Altitude adjustment**: May need slightly more flour at high altitude
- **Variations**: Try walnuts, add orange zest to filling
- **Cardamom**: Key flavor - don't skip!
- **Yield**: 12 generous rolls, perfect for holiday brunch
