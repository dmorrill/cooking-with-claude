## Ingredients

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Cream cheese (room temp) | 380g (13.5 oz / 1½ packages) |
| Granulated sugar | 150g (¾ cup) |
| Pumpkin puree (thick, drained) | 110g (½ cup) |
| Heavy cream | 75g (⅓ cup) |
| Large eggs | 2 whole |
| Egg yolk | 1 |
| All-purpose flour | 12g (1 Tbsp) |
| Vanilla extract | 1½ tsp |
| Pumpkin pie spice | 1¼ tsp |
| Kosher salt | ¼ tsp |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Roast Pumpkin (if using fresh) - Do 1-2 days ahead
1. Cut small sugar pumpkin in half, scoop seeds
2. Roast cut-side down at 375°F for 45-60 minutes until soft
3. Puree and **drain in cheesecloth 30-60 minutes** - must be thick!

### Step 2: Prep Pan (10 minutes)
4. Preheat oven to 475°F
5. Crumple 2 sheets parchment paper, unfold (creates signature wrinkled look)
6. Line 6-inch springform pan with cross pattern
7. Let excess hang over edges

### Step 3: Make Batter (10 minutes)
**Food Processor Method:**
8. Add all ingredients: cream cheese, sugar, pumpkin, cream, eggs, yolk, vanilla, flour, spices, salt
9. Blend on high 3-4 minutes until completely smooth

### Step 4: Bake (28-35 minutes at 475°F)
10. Pour batter into prepared pan
11. Bake until:
    - Top is deeply browned (almost burnt - this is correct!)
    - Center still jiggly like Jell-O
12. Don't overbake! Jiggle = creamy texture

### Step 5: Cool (3+ hours)
13. Cool to room temperature (1-2 hours)
14. It will deflate and sink - this is normal!
15. Refrigerate at least 2 hours (overnight best)

### Step 6: Serve
16. Slice with hot knife (dip in hot water, wipe between cuts)
17. Serve chilled or room temperature

## Notes

- **No sour cream**: Authentic La Viña style - extra cream cheese makes it richer
- **High heat essential**: 475°F creates signature burnt caramelized top
- **Jiggly center**: Very important - sets as it cools
- **Wrinkled parchment**: Iconic Basque aesthetic
- **Deflation normal**: Part of the rustic charm
- **Best next day**: Flavors meld after overnight refrigeration
- **Pumpkin drainage critical**: Too-wet puree = watery cheesecake

## Storage

- Refrigerate up to 5 days, covered
- Freeze up to 2 months wrapped tightly
