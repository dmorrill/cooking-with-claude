# When Your Side Project Becomes Magic: The MCP Update That Changed Everything

*Published on X.com - January 1, 2026*

---

A few days ago, [I posted about the improvements](https://x.com/DanielleMorrill/status/2006003493098734028) I'd been making to cooking-with-claude. Recipe reorganization. Better workflows. Nice incremental progress.

Today? Today I asked Claude to upgrade itself, and my mind is blown.

## The Timeline

**December 28**: Reorganizing recipes, improving workflows, good solid work
**January 1**: "Hey Claude, can you add inventory management to the MCP server?"
**30 minutes later**: I'm updating my pantry by talking to Claude Desktop like it's my sous chef

The speed of this shift is breaking my brain.

## What Just Happened

I asked Claude Code to build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for my cooking system. Not to write some functions. Not to help me plan it. To BUILD THE WHOLE THING.

It wrote 1,400 lines of code that:
- Created 9 working tools for recipe and inventory management
- Handles all the file I/O and markdown parsing
- Auto-detects paths (zero configuration!)
- Just... works

Then I installed it in 2 minutes and now I can say things like:
- "What can I make in 30 minutes with what I have?"
- "Add milk to the upstairs fridge, expires January 15"
- "Find recipes that use mushrooms"
- "What's expiring soon?"

No code. No terminal. Just conversation.

## The Leap from Good to Magic

Look at the progression:

**Version 1**: "Here's a markdown template for recipes"
**Version 2**: "Now recipes are organized in folders"
**Version 2.1**: "Now just TALK TO CLAUDE ABOUT YOUR COOKING"

It's like going from:
- Horse → Better horse → CAR

## The Part That's Breaking Me

I've been building software for 20 years. The normal cycle is:
1. Have idea (5 minutes)
2. Design system (2 days)
3. Write code (2 weeks)
4. Debug (??? weeks)
5. Documentation (lol never)
6. Actually use it (maybe)

The new cycle:
1. Have idea (5 minutes)
2. Ask Claude (1 minute)
3. Watch it build itself (30 minutes)
4. Use it immediately (forever)

## Real Results This Week

Since adding the MCP server:
- Found dinner without shopping 3 nights in a row
- Discovered forgotten frozen salmon in the basement
- Used up $40 of food that would have gone bad
- Added groceries to inventory as I unpacked them - just by talking

But more importantly: **I actually enjoy maintaining the system now.**

No friction. No "I should update my inventory but ugh, editing markdown." Just "Hey Claude, we're out of olive oil."

## The Open Source Magic

Everything's on GitHub: [cooking-with-claude](https://github.com/dmorrill/cooking-with-claude)

What's wild is you don't need to understand the code. You need to:
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Add 3 lines to a config file
4. Start talking to Claude about cooking

Your AI assistant can literally walk you through setting up its own upgrades.

## The Philosophical Bit

We talk about "eating your own dog food" in software. This is deeper. This is the tool improving itself. Claude Code gave Claude Desktop new powers because I asked nicely.

If AI can upgrade itself this easily, what else is possible?

Today: "Add inventory management"
Tomorrow: "Notice I always forget to defrost chicken and remind me"
Next week: "Track my nutrition and suggest improvements"
Next month: "Plan my garden based on what I cook most"

The barrier isn't technical anymore. It's imagination.

## The Call to Action

If you cook (or want to cook more), grab this system. It's free, open source, and Claude will help you set it up.

But more importantly: What system in YOUR life needs this treatment?

What friction could disappear if you just... asked?

What would you build if building took 30 minutes instead of 30 days?

## We're Living in the Future

That [previous post](https://x.com/DanielleMorrill/status/2006003493098734028) feels like it was from a different era, and it was 4 days ago.

The pace of improvement isn't just fast. It's exponential. And we can all ride this wave.

I asked my AI to upgrade itself. It did. Now I have cooking superpowers everywhere Claude runs.

If that's not living in the future, I don't know what is.

*P.S. - Started this as a "cooking app" to manage my ADHD kitchen chaos. Now it's become a glimpse into a world where software builds itself based on conversation. The future is wilder than we think.*

*P.P.S. - Yes, Claude helped write this post about Claude building Claude new features. The recursion is not lost on me. Or on Claude. We both think it's hilarious.*
