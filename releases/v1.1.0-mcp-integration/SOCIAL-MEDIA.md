The magic: It takes 2 minutes to set up and then just works.

Ask Claude Desktop:

Your cooking system maintains itself through conversation.

**Title:** Launched: Natural Language Cooking Management with Claude Desktop

I'm excited to share a major update to cooking-with-claude, my open-source cooking management system.

**The Problem:** Every cooking app fails at the same point - maintaining the data. You cook something great, but you're exhausted, and updating three different screens feels like work.

**The Solution:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration that lets you talk naturally to Claude Desktop:
- "What can I make with what I have?"
- "Add chicken to the freezer"
- "What's expiring soon?"

**Real Impact:**
• 70% reduction in food waste
• $40/week saved on groceries
• 50+ new recipes successfully cooked
• Zero friction inventory management

**Technical Implementation:**
Built on MCP protocol, maintaining human-readable markdown files, fully version-controlled, runs locally. Setup takes 2 minutes.

This project started as a personal tool for managing ADHD kitchen chaos. Two months later, it's transformed how I cook and meal plan.

If you struggle with meal planning, food waste, or just want to cook more efficiently, give it a try: github.com/dmorrill/cooking-with-claude

⭐ We're aiming for 100 GitHub stars by January 31st to help others discover the project. Currently at [X]/100 - every star helps!

## Reddit r/selfhosted Version

**Title:** [Update] Natural language cooking management - now with Claude Desktop MCP integration!

Hey r/selfhosted! A month ago I shared my markdown-based cooking system. Based on your feedback, I've added something game-changing: MCP server integration.

**What's new:**
- Talk to Claude Desktop naturally about your cooking
- "What can I make with what's in my pantry?"
- "Add eggs to fridge, expires next week"
- "Find recipes under 30 minutes"

**The setup:**
1. Clone repo
2. `npm install` in cooking-mcp folder
3. Add 3 lines to claude_desktop_config.json
4. Done

**Why this matters:**
- Everything stays local (your data, your control)
- Still just markdown files (git-friendly)
- No cloud services, no accounts, no BS
- Actually maintains itself through conversation

**Real results:**
- 70% less food waste
- Found 3 meals I could make without shopping this week
- Finally using that basement freezer efficiently

Code: github.com/dmorrill/cooking-with-claude

If you've tried meal planning apps and given up (like I did 10x), this might actually stick because the friction is finally gone.

Would love your feedback and feature requests!

## Hacker News Version

**Title:** Show HN: Natural Language Cooking via Claude Desktop MCP

I built an MCP server that lets you manage cooking/recipes through conversation with Claude Desktop.

**Technical details:**
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in Node.js
- Reads/writes markdown files for data persistence
- 9 tools exposed: recipe search, inventory CRUD, meal planning
- Auto-detects repo location, zero config

**Why I built this:**
Every cooking app dies at data maintenance. You're tired after cooking, updating the app feels like work, system goes stale. Natural language finally fixes this.

**Interesting challenges solved:**
- Parsing markdown tables while preserving formatting
- Fuzzy ingredient matching across recipes/inventory
- Expiration date tracking without a database
- Meal suggestions ranked by available ingredients + expiration priority

**Results:**
- 70% reduction in food waste
- 50+ new recipes cooked (actually stuck with the system!)
- 2-minute setup → immediate value

GitHub: github.com/dmorrill/cooking-with-claude

Would love feedback from the HN community, especially on the MCP implementation and ideas for extending the protocol.

## Instagram Caption Version

🎉 Big update for all my meal-planning friends!

You know that moment when you stare at your fridge wondering what to make? Now you can literally ask Claude: "What can I make with what I have?" and get real answers based on YOUR actual ingredients.

No more:
❌ Forgotten leftovers dying in the back
❌ Buying ingredients you already have
❌ Recipe apps that don't know your kitchen

Just natural conversation:
✨ "Add the leftover soup to the fridge"
✨ "What's expiring soon?"
✨ "Find me a 20-minute dinner"

I built this for my ADHD brain that can't handle complex apps. Two months later: 70% less food waste, 50+ new recipes tried, and I actually enjoy meal planning now.

Free, open-source, takes 2 min to set up.
