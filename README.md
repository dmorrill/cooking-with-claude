## Requirements

This project uses **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)**, Anthropic's command-line tool for Claude. Claude Code can read and edit files on your computer, which is what makes this cooking system work - it reads your inventory files to suggest meals you can actually make.

**You'll need:**
- A Claude Pro, Max, or Team subscription ($20+/month)
- macOS or Linux (Windows via WSL)
- Node.js 18+

### Optional: MCP Server for Claude Desktop

If you also use Claude Desktop, there's an included MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives Claude direct access to your cooking data. This lets you ask questions like "What can I make with what's in my fridge?" directly in Claude Desktop. See the [MCP Setup Guide](#mcp-server-optional) below.

## Setup

### 1. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### 2. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmorrill/cooking-with-claude.git
cd cooking-with-claude
```

### 3. Launch Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

That's it! Claude will automatically read the `CLAUDE.md` file in this directory and understand how to help you with meal planning.

### 4. Start using it

Once Claude Code is running, try:
```
"What can I cook in 30 minutes with what I have?"
```

Claude will read your inventory files and suggest meals based on what's actually in your kitchen.

## Quick Start

**Tonight's Dinner in 3 Steps:**
1. Ask: *"What can I cook in 30 minutes with what I have?"*
2. Get AI suggestions with exact ingredient locations
3. Cook with confidence - no missing ingredients, no food waste

## Core Features

### Smart Meal Matching
- AI suggests meals based on your actual inventory
- Filters by prep time, dietary needs, and available ingredients
- Shows exact storage locations for each ingredient

### Complete Recipe System
- Time-organized recipe database (15min, 30min, 45min+)
- Standardized templates for consistent formatting
- Family favorites and emergency 5-ingredient meals

### Inventory Intelligence
- Multi-location tracking (customize to your home layout)
- Expiration monitoring with usage prioritization
- Auto-generated shopping lists from meal plans

## AI-Powered Workflows

### Meal Planning Commands
```
"What dinner recipes can I make in 30 minutes or less using only ingredients I have?"
"Plan 5 dinners for this week using mostly what I have on hand"
"What meals can I make using items expiring in the next 3 days?"
"What's the quickest meal I can make right now with zero shopping?"
```

### Inventory Management
```
"Check all my inventory and suggest 3 dinner options under 30 minutes"
"Generate a shopping list for next week's meal plan"
"What ingredients are expiring soon that I should use first?"
"Update my downstairs pantry inventory"
```

## Weekly Workflow

1. **Sunday Planning**: Review inventory, plan week's meals
2. **Shopping**: Auto-generated lists from meal plans
3. **Daily Cooking**: AI suggests meals based on time available
4. **Inventory Updates**: Track usage and expiration dates

## Cooking Modes

### Prep-and-Assemble Mode
**Best for:** Teaching new recipes, collaborative cooking, reducing cooking anxiety

**How it works:**
- **Person A's role**: All prep work (chopping, measuring, making sauces, setting up station)
- **Person B's role**: Cooking and assembly (following clear step-by-step instructions)

**What Claude Code does:**
1. Creates detailed task list with recipe and ingredient locations
2. Divides tasks into prep work and cooking steps
3. Guides prep with exact measurements and cutting techniques
4. Organizes ingredients into numbered containers
5. Creates calendar invitations with comprehensive cooking instructions

**Perfect recipes for this mode:**
- Cold noodle salads
- Stir-fries
- Buddha bowls
- Tacos and burrito bowls
- Grain salads

**Command:** *"Let's get organized to prep ingredients for [meal] tonight"*

See `templates/prep-and-assemble-workflow.md` for full workflow details.

## Why This System Works

- **No Food Waste**: Use what you have before it expires
- **Save Time**: Stop wondering "what's for dinner?"
- **Save Money**: Shop with purpose, avoid duplicate purchases
- **Less Stress**: Always know you can make something good

## Getting Started (After Setup)

### Path 1: Just Use the Recipes (Simple)
1. **Browse recipes**: Check out [recipes/README.md](recipes/README.md) for the full index
2. **Cook something**: Ask Claude *"Walk me through making the cacio e pepe step by step"*
3. **Add your own**: Paste a recipe PDF or describe a dish you want to add
4. **Plan a meal**: See the [Thanksgiving example](examples/thanksgiving-2025/) for complex meal planning

### Path 2: Full System with Inventory (Advanced)
1. **Populate your inventory**: Tell Claude *"Help me fill out my kitchen pantry inventory"*
2. **Customize locations**: Adjust inventory folders to match your home layout
3. **Get AI suggestions**: *"What can I cook in 30 minutes with what I have?"*
4. **Keep it updated**: Tell Claude when you buy groceries or use things up

## Customization

This template is designed to be customized to your home:

- **Rename inventory folders**: Change `upstairs/downstairs` to match your layout
- **Add/remove storage locations**: Not everyone has a basement or chest freezer
- **Adjust recipe categories**: Organize by cuisine, dietary restrictions, or whatever works for you

## MCP Server (Optional)

If you use Claude Desktop, you can enable the included MCP server for direct access to your cooking data. This lets you:
- Search recipes by ingredients or prep time
- Check your inventory across all locations
- Get meal suggestions based on what you have
- Update inventory directly from Claude Desktop
- Find items expiring soon

### MCP Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
cd cooking-mcp
npm install
```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop:**

Find your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the cooking MCP server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cooking-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/cooking-with-claude/cooking-mcp/src/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/cooking-with-claude` with your actual path.

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

4. **Try it out!** Ask Claude Desktop:
   - "What recipes can I make in 30 minutes?"
   - "Check my pantry inventory"
   - "Add milk to upstairs refrigerator"
   - "What's expiring soon?"

For full MCP documentation, see [cooking-mcp/README.md](cooking-mcp/README.md).
